As I embark on my journey into the ITM 350: System Analysis and Design class this spring of 2024 (April - July), the course has introduced us to the usage of GitHub. GitHub serves as a platform for real-world organizational collaboration within teams, emphasizing the importance of version control, team collaboration, and other best practices essential for effective project management.

I must admit that I am still in the process of learning how to navigate GitHub and Git effectively. However, I am eager to learn and utilize these tools throughout the semester. I welcome any assistance and guidance from my teammates in this class, as well as from anyone else willing to offer their expertise. Your advice and insights will be invaluable as I strive to improve my skills in GitHub and Git.

Here's to a productive and enriching semester ahead!
